# skateKAPPA

This mod will change the language files and the chat at runtime. It changes:

  * `Copper` to `Kappa`
  * `Melon` to `Melan`
  * `Dandelion` to `Dandeldideldon`
  * `Cookie` or `Keks` to `KeXs`

You might as well see some cows without head in your world. Also naming a sheep `derNiklaas` will give it a different look.

One last thing: Please don't try to write `Lampenbl√∂cke` or `lamp blocks` on a sign, it won't work.
